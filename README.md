# DEEPFAKE-AI-VOICE
The file size is very big now I am uploading the link of the google drive where you can find the full code and dataset link as well download the both folder and put the dataset folder into deepfakv voice
The code and documentation link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AHHZMNkB_AR0oRobfIyshOHNYL1s9vQ6?usp=sharing
data set link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y2hL0Vu6ymCEPY00fLizxsL52szd3zDM?usp=sharing
install all the dependencies
then write python app.py and for ubuntu python3.py
you will then go to the link http://127.0.0.1:5000 which is localhost and upload a small audio file and then you will get the result wheater it is human voice or Ai voice
Remember I trained this model only for 40 dataset so the accuracy is not that level good but the model is good
You will find the documentation in the format of pdf where you will all the necessary things which you required
